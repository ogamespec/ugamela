At greater depths, the mines can produce more output of viable metal for use in the construction of buildings, ships, defense systems, and research. As the mines drill deeper, more energy is required for maximum production.

If your target has a higher level of Espionage Technology than you, you will need to launch more probes to gather all the information on your target. However this runs the great risk of detection by your target, resulting in the probes destruction. However, launching too few probes will result in missing information that is most critical, which could result in the total destruction of your fleet if an attack is launched.

At certain levels of Espionage Technology research, new attack warning systems are installed:

At Level 2, the total number of attacking ships will be displayed along with the simple attack warning.
At Level 4, the type of attacking ships along with the number of ships are displayed.

If an opening is provided at the bottom of the chamber then the pressure is no longer opposed on that side. The remaining pressure gives a resultant thrust in the side opposite the opening, which propels the ship forward by expelling the exhaust rearwards at extreme high speed.

The fusion reaction generates a highly energized plasma. This plasma, ("electro-plasma") can be employed for propulsion, or can be diverted through the EPS to the power transfer grid, via EPS conduits, so as to supply other systems. The accelerated plasma is passed through the driver coils, thereby generating a subspace field which improves the propulsive effect.

Hyperspace is an alternate region of space co-existing with our own universe which may be entered using an energy field or other device. The HyperSpace Drive utilizes this alternate region by distorting the space-time continuum, which results in speeds that exceed the speed of light (otherwise known as FTL travel). During FTL travel, time and space is warped to the point that results in a trip that would normally take 1000 light years to be completed, to be accomplished in about an hour.

It was quickly learned that a new class of ship was needed to maximize resources captured in raids, yet also be cost effective. After much development, the Large Cargo was born.

To maximize the resources that can be stored in the holds, this ship has little in the way of weapons or armor. Thanks to the highly developed combustion engine installed, it serves as the most economical resource supplier between planets, and most effective in raids on hostile worlds.

Cruisers are armored almost three times of that of the heavy fighters, and possess more than twice the firepower of any combat ship in existence. They also possess speeds that far surpassed any spacecraft ever made. For almost a century, cruisers dominated the universe. However, with the development of Gauss cannons and plasma turrets, their predominance ended. They are still used today against fighter groups, but not as predominantly as before.

Solar Satellites gather solar energy and transmit it to a ground station using advanced laser technology. The efficiency of a solar satellite depends on the strength of the solar radiation it receives. In principle, energy production in orbits closer to the sun is greater than for planets in orbits distant from the sun. Since the satellites primary goal is the transmission of energy, they lack shielding and weapons capability, and because of this they are usually destroyed in large numbers in a major battle.

Because the destroyer is very large, its maneuverability is severely limited, which makes it more of a battle station than a fighting ship. The lack of maneuverability is made up for by its sheer firepower, but it also costs significant amounts of deuterium to build and operate.

$lang['info'][407]['description'] = 'Colonizing new worlds brought about a new danger, space debris. A large asteroid could easily wipe out the world and all inhabitants. Advancements in shielding technology provided scientists with a way to develop a shield to protect an entire planet not only from space debris but, as it was learned, from an enemy attack. By creating a large electromagnetic field around the planet, space debris that would normally have destroyed the planet was deflected, and attacks from enemy Empires were thwarted. The first generators were large and the shield provided moderate protection, but it was later discovered that small shields did not afford the protection from larger scale attacks. The small shield dome was the prelude to a stronger, more advanced planetary shielding system to come.

After a battle, there is up to a 70 % chance that failed defensive facilities can be returned to use.

Built to withstand a larger barrage of enemy fire by providing a higher energized electromagnetic field, large domes provide a longer period of protection before collapsing.

$lang['info'][41]['description'] = 'Since a moon has no atmosphere and is an extremely hostile environment, a lunar base must first be built before the moon can be developed. The Lunar Base provides oxygen, heating, and gravity to create a living environment for the colonists. With each level constructed, a larger living and development area is provided within the biosphere. With each level of the Lunar Base constructed, three fields are developed for other buildings. 
Once built, the lunar base can not be torn down.';

$lang['info'][42]['name'] = 'Sensor Phalanx';
$lang['info'][42]['description'] = 'Utilizing high-resolution sensors, the Sensor Phalanx first scans the spectrum of light, composition of gases, and radiation emissions from a distant world and transmits the data to a supercomputer for processing. Once the information is obtained, the supercomputer compares changes in the spectrum, gas composition, and radiation emissions, to a base line chart of known changes of the spectrum created by various ship movements. The resulting data then displays activity of any fleet within the range of the phalanx. To prevent the supercomputer from overheating during the process, it is cooled by utilizing 5k of processed Deuterium. 
To use the Phalanx, click on any planet in the Galaxy View within your sensors range.';

Utilizing technology similar to that of a Worm Hole to achieve the jump, deuterium is not required. A recharge period of one hour must pass between jumps to allow for regeneration. Transporting resources through the Gate is not possible.';

Scientists all over the universe worried about the threat of a nuclear bombardment from a rogue leader. So it was decided to use the same technology as a deterrent from launching such a horrible attack.

Missile silos are used to construct, store and launch interplanetary and anti-ballistic missiles. With each level of the silo, five interplanetary missiles or ten anti-ballistic missiles can be stored. Storage of both Interplanetary missiles and Anti-Ballistic missiles in the same silo is allowed.';

$lang['info'][502]['description'] = 'Anti Ballistic Missiles (ABM) are your only line of defense when attacked by Interplanetary Missiles (IPM). When a launch of IPMs is detected, these missiles automatically arm, process a launch code in their flight computers, target the inbound IPM, and launch to intercept. During the flight, the target IPM is constantly tracked and course corrections are applied until the ABM reaches the target and destroys the attacking IPM. Each ABM destroys one incoming IPM. 

Each level of your missile silo developed can store 10 ABMs, 5 IPMs, or a combination of both missile types. ';

Using state of the art tracking technology, each missile targets a certain number of defenses for destruction. Tipped with an anti-matter bomb, they deliver a destructive force so severe that destroyed shields and defenses cannot be repaired. The only way to counter these missiles is with APMs.

Each level of your missile silo developed can store 10 ABMs, 5 IPMs, or a combination of both missile types. ';
